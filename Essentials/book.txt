Welcome!  Here's some basic commands to get started!

Use /kits to view kits of tools you can use.  To claim a kit, type /kit [kit name].

Explore the spawn zone. There is a portal to different biomes to explore and start your settlement, or you can choose to leave the spawn area and start in the wilderness.

As you play on the server, your rank will increase over time.

Members can create a faction and claim land.  Claimed land can not be destroyed by other players (except from explosions). Anyone can join another faction.  Use /f help to learn about faction commands.
